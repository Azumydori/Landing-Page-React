Let's build this landing page collaborately using React Function Components. The idea is to split Bootstrap components into different function Components, they'll be all imported in the main component Home.jsx

The key of this project is to help you understand how to pick the components that you want to build, you have to think the best way to organize and avoid future errors. What can be re-used? If your code is tuning into something big and hard to understand you probably will need to split into components: <Jumbotron />, <Navbar />, <Card />.
